### 3. Add New Peer
To add a new peering with AS4242421732, follow these steps:
1. Edit the desired location file: Add your new peering information (name, IPv4, IPv6 (link-local or dn42 IPv6), AS number, session type, WireGuard data, email/other contact).

|:warning: WARNING|
|:-|
|**If you're using WireGuard preshared key**|

Add ```preshared_key``` to the WireGuard section:
```
wireguard:
  endpoint_address: '1.1.1.1'
  endpoint_port: '15887'
  preshared_key: 'oTpSP6Hr4/bGtnJJu/xrcqtiVA0c+Ql9yv7yGYGE1t0=
  public_key: 'yZO+2Fo7uHikVC2VUPYwkk9IBzojUqrJlTU2fyfzfgI='
```

#### Example BGP Configuration for Multi-prototol session:
```
  - name: 'fr1.g-load.eu'
    contacts: 'https://dn42.g-load.eu'
    wireguard:
      endpoint_address: 'fr1.g-load.eu'
      endpoint_port: '21732'
      public_key: 'sLbzTRr2gfLFb24NPzDOpy8j09Y6zI+a7NkeVMdVSR8='
    address:
      ipv6: 'fe80::ade0'
      ipv4: '172.20.53.102'
    bgp:
      asn: '4242423914'
      session: 'mp'
```
#### Example BGP Configuration for IPv6 only session:
```
  - name: 'fr1.g-load.eu'
    contacts: 'https://dn42.g-load.eu'
    wireguard:
      endpoint_address: 'fr1.g-load.eu'
      endpoint_port: '21732'
      public_key: 'sLbzTRr2gfLFb24NPzDOpy8j09Y6zI+a7NkeVMdVSR8='
    address:
      ipv6: 'fe80::ade0'
    bgp:
      asn: '4242423914'
      session: 'ipv6'
```
#### Example BGP Configuration for IPv4 only session:
```
  - name: 'fr1.g-load.eu'
    contacts: 'https://dn42.g-load.eu'
    wireguard:
      endpoint_address: 'fr1.g-load.eu'
      endpoint_port: '21732'
      public_key: 'sLbzTRr2gfLFb24NPzDOpy8j09Y6zI+a7NkeVMdVSR8='
    address:
      ipv4: '172.20.53.102'
    bgp:
      asn: '4242423914'
      session: 'ipv4'
```
#### Example BGP Configuration for two separate IPv4 & IPv6 sessions:
```
  - name: 'fr1.g-load.eu'
    contacts: 'https://dn42.g-load.eu'
    wireguard:
      endpoint_address: 'fr1.g-load.eu'
      endpoint_port: '21732'
      public_key: 'sLbzTRr2gfLFb24NPzDOpy8j09Y6zI+a7NkeVMdVSR8='
    address:
      ipv6: 'fe80::ade0'
      ipv4: '172.20.53.102'
    bgp:
      asn: '4242423914'
      session: 'ipv4+ipv6'
```

2. Push Changes: After you've added the new peer configuration, you can commit your changes to your local copy of the repository:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Added peering with $your_peer_name"
```
Then push your changes to GitHub (you must fork the repository first if you haven't):
```
git push origin main
```
Once approved and merged, we automatically distribute your configuration to the routers in our network. Please allow some time (up to 5 minutes) for the process to complete.
